// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "2nd step, understanding what the user expectations and experience will be"
const design = "3rd step, envisioning and defining the software solutions to a problem or set of problems"
const Implementation = "4th step, launching, integrating, and adopting a software application into a business workflow"
const testingAndIntegration = "5th step, ensuring the software will work with other programs the end user is using"
const maintain = "final step, changint modifying or updating software to keep up with end user needs"
